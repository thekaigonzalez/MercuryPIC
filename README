Mercury PIC

  a bytecode format designed to be 100% ABI compatible with NexFUSE

  MercuryPIC has very small memory footprint, being 100% compatible with the
  NexFUSE format, provides low-level abstractions which allow for performant
  binary programs made for the NexFUSE family of formats.

  To see the real differences, compile this program, then run the examples with
  both `runfuse' and `mpic', and compare their valgrind memory usage.

  in NexFUSE's `algo.asm':

        total heap usage: 8,021 allocs, 8,021 frees, 287,951 bytes allocated
        ERROR SUMMARY: 2059 errors from 16 contexts (suppressed: 0 from 0)

  in MercuryPIC:

        total heap usage: 1,366 allocs, 1,366 frees, 59,233 bytes allocated
        ERROR SUMMARY: 0 errors from 0 contexts (suppressed: 0 from 0)

  * blazingly fast ðŸ”¥
  * 100% compatible with NexFUSE
  * very small memory footprint
  * very fast (so important we had to put it twice)
